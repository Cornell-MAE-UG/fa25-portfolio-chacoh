## About Me

Hi, I'm Charlie. I'm a junior from Chicago studying Mechanical Engineering at Cornell University. This isn't my actual portfolio, rather a collection of required school assignments for my classes. If you've found this somehow, please checkout my real portfolio at <a href="https://charliecohen.com/">charliecohen.com<\a>.


If you're here for one of my Cornell assignments, check out <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my projects</a> and <a href="{{ "/cv/" | relative_url }}">CV</a>.
