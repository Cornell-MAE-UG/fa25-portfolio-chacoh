Hi, I'm Charlie. This isn't my actual portfolio, rather a collection of required school assignments for my classes. If you've found this somehow, please checkout my real portfolio at <a href="https://charliecohen.com/">charliecohen.com</a>. Thanks, and sorry for the confusion.


If you're here to see one of my Cornell assignments, check out <a href="{{ "/projects/" | relative_url }}">my required school projects</a>.
