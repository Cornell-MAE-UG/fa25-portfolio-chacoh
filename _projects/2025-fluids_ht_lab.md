As part of MAE 4272, you will create a simple professional engineering portfolio and publish a short webpage describing your Blade Design Project. This page is something you can share externally for example with recruiters. Create a page in your portfolio that summarizes your team’s blade design work. This should be written at a level appropriate for a hiring manager or technical recruiter.

Your page must include:
Project overview: What you were asked to design and why
Design process: Key decisions, iterations, or modeling steps your team performed
Testing summary: How the blades were tested and what data you analyzed
Your contribution: Briefly describe what you worked on
Figures: Plots, CAD image, and photos 

This is not a full technical report. Aim for 2–4 concise paragraphs plus 1–3 informative graphics.
