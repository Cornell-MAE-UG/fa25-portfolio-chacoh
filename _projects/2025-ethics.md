To address the portfolio prompt, I compliled responses to each of my five guiding questions that I followed throughout our investigation into the ethical problem created by the Boeing 737-MAX crashes.

## 1. Should the FAA be delegating regulatory work to Boeing through Designated Engineering Representatives (DERs)?
The FAA’s delegation of certification authority to Boeing DERs significantly weakened independent oversight of Boeing and contributed to the MCAS failures. Under CFR Title 14 §183.29, DERs are permitted to approve work within their area of expertise, yet by 2018 Boeing DERs were certifying approximately 96% of Boeing’s work internally. This level of delegation created a system in which the regulated entity effectively regulated itself. Regulatory ambiguity allowed Boeing to decide who was “qualified” to certify its work, reducing the FAA’s direct involvement in verifying safety-critical systems like MCAS.
MCAS was introduced as a software fix to address aerodynamic changes caused by repositioned, larger engines on the 737 MAX. Although it was initially approved as a limited modification, its operational scope expanded late in development to include lower Mach numbers, without full re-certification or independent reassessment. Design engineers reasonably assumed their work was being properly reviewed because DERs and test pilots were involved, but information silos prevented engineers from understanding how certification decisions were actually made. Organizational pressure to meet accelerated timelines further shortened the certification process and discouraged deeper technical scrutiny.
This delegation framework created an ethical conflict between ASME Canon 4 (acting as a faithful agent of one’s employer) and Canon 7 (issuing truthful and complete statements to the public). Boeing DERs were expected to certify work in a way that supported Boeing’s business goals while also protecting public safety. Per ASME Canon 2, engineers and regulators should only perform duties within their areas of competence. Greater FAA involvement—or restricting certification authority to the original MCAS subject-matter experts—could have ensured that scope changes were fully understood and may have prevented the unsafe expansion of MCAS.

## 2. Should Boeing management have prioritized aggressive timelines and business success, or engineering safety?
Boeing management’s prioritization of aggressive timelines and cost control over engineering safety represents a fundamental ethical failure. Rather than designing a new aircraft to compete with Airbus, Boeing chose to update the existing 737 platform to save time and money. This decision introduced significant engineering constraints, ultimately requiring MCAS as a software solution to compensate for altered aircraft aerodynamics. Management’s focus on speed and cost placed immense pressure on engineers and reduced opportunities for thorough testing and validation.
Evidence shows that management repeatedly prioritized financial success over safety. Boeing promised airlines financial incentives—such as up to $1 million per aircraft to Southwest Airlines—to avoid simulator training requirements, and CEO Dennis Muilenberg pressed the FAA to allow aircraft deliveries before certification was complete. Engineers reported working at twice the normal pace, producing large volumes of design output under compressed schedules. Airlines trusted Boeing’s long-standing reputation and were largely unaware of the organizational strain and safety trade-offs occurring internally.
This situation reflects a direct conflict between ASME Canon 1, which requires engineers and organizations to hold public safety paramount, and Canon 4, which emphasizes loyalty to one’s employer. Boeing management resolved this conflict in favor of business success. Ethically, Canon 1 should have taken precedence. Management should have accepted delays, higher costs, and additional training requirements in order to rigorously test MCAS as a new safety-critical system and ensure the protection of passengers, pilots, and the public.

## 3. What changes should Boeing have communicated to airlines, pilots, the FAA, and the public about MCAS?
Boeing failed to communicate critical information about the design, function, and risks of MCAS, undermining trust and violating professional ethical obligations. Boeing and the FAA agreed to portray MCAS as a minor modification rather than a new system, minimizing its perceived significance. Internally, individuals such as Mark Forkner withheld key information from the FAA to avoid triggering costly pilot training requirements. As a result, pilots were not informed about MCAS’s existence, its authority to command nose-down trim, or its reliance on a single AOA sensor.
These omissions violated ASME Canons 1, 6, and 7, which require engineers to protect public safety, communicate clearly, and make only truthful public statements. Decisions about what to disclose were often made by management or senior engineers who did not directly design MCAS, conflicting with Canon 2’s requirement to act within one’s area of competence. Organizational silos between design engineers, technical writers, regulators, and pilots further prevented accurate and complete information from reaching those who needed it most.
Had Boeing fully disclosed MCAS’s operation in pilot manuals, training programs, and public communications, and allowed subject-matter experts to guide that disclosure, pilots could have better understood and responded to abnormal behavior. Transparent communication would have supported informed decision-making by airlines and regulators and could have prevented the accidents that followed.

## 4. Should Boeing DERs have certified MCAS knowing it was largely untested and dependent on a single AOA sensor?
Boeing DERs should not have certified MCAS in its final configuration given its limited testing, lack of redundancy, and expanded operational scope. MCAS relied on a single AOA sensor, creating a single point of failure in a life-critical flight control system. Engineers assumed the sensor would always be properly calibrated and reliable, but this assumption proved false. Additionally, MCAS’s scope expanded late in development without sufficient reanalysis or testing.
DERs faced intense organizational pressure to certify the aircraft quickly and not challenge management decisions. Although DERs initially approved MCAS for a limited operating envelope, management later expanded its authority, and DERs were expected to certify the changes under accelerated timelines. This created a conflict between ASME Canon 3 (ethical development and judgment) and Canon 5 (protecting proprietary information), as well as pressure to conform to company interests.
Ethically, ASME Canon 1 takes precedence: public safety must come first. DERs should have refused to certify MCAS until redundancy was added, testing was complete, and the system’s full operational scope was properly evaluated. Certifying a single-sensor, safety-critical system under these conditions violated the ethical responsibility engineers owe to the public.

## 5. Should the government have enforced stronger whistleblower protections and encouraged a culture of accountability?
The lack of strong whistleblower protections and an accountability-focused culture significantly contributed to the failure to identify and correct MCAS risks. Boeing fostered an environment in which engineers feared retaliation for raising concerns, reinforced by actions such as hiding non-conforming parts from FAA inspectors and withholding critical information from regulators. Engineers reasonably believed that speaking out could jeopardize their careers, leading them to remain silent despite ethical concerns.
This environment conflicted with ASME Canon 9, which prohibits retaliation against engineers who act ethically, even when doing so harms their employer’s interests. While Canon 4 emphasizes loyalty to one’s employer, it cannot override obligations to public safety and ethical conduct. Regulatory ambiguity further discouraged reporting, as engineers were unsure what protections existed or how they would be enforced.
Stronger government enforcement of whistleblower protections, clearer reporting channels, and cultural normalization of ethical dissent could have enabled engineers to raise concerns earlier. Had engineers felt safe speaking out, MCAS’s flaws may have been identified, tested, and corrected before entering service—potentially saving lives and preserving public trust in both Boeing and the regulatory system.
